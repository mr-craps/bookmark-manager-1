<h1>Read Later</h1>
<h2>A revolution in the world of social bookmarking</h2>
Read Later is a fictional service designed to test a range of skills using the .net core 5 MVC architecture. For full details about this project, the libraries used, and a quickstart guide to getting it up and running, please visit the About page

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>Please complete 3 of the below exercises.  You will need to complete the first 2, and then choose 1 from the remaining 3 however feel free to complete more than 3, or to elaborate on the ways you achieve the solution.</p>

    This test is designed to measure your coding knowledge and skill however as time is limited you are not expected to produce 100% production ready code in all cases.  Most important is that the code works, and has the correct logical process
    and structure to solve the problem.  Coding standards e.g. error logging and reporting, correct variable naming, conde commenting, unit testing are not required - you won't lose marks for forgetting to check a null reference here and there!

<h4>The following has been implemented:</h4>
